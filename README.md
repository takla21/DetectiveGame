# Detective Game

## Description
Detective Game is an immersive experience where you play as a detective tasked with uncovering the identity of a killer in a bustling city filled with civilians.

## Architecture
The game is developed using [MonoGames](https://monogame.net/) and .NET 9. Unit tests are written using (xunit)[https://xunit.net/] to ensure code quality and reliability.

## Goal
This project started as a side endeavor to deepen my expertise in C# and .NET. If completed, it was intended for release on Steam or another gaming platform.
